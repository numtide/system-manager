# System Manager

**System Manager** brings the power of NixOS-style declarative configuration to any Linux system.  
Describe what your system should look like, packages, services, and settings, all in Nix, then apply it safely and atomically with a single command. Each change is reproducible and rollback-ready, just like NixOS generations but without needing to actually run NixOS.

!!! tip "Think of it as Home Manager for your entire machine"
    Where Home Manager manages user environments, System Manager manages the full system—root-level configuration, packages, and services—using the same reliable, Nix-based model.
