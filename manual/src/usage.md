# Usage

The [`system-manager` nix module](https://github.com/numtide/system-manager/blob/main/nix/modules/default.nix) currently supports the following `options`:

- management of [`systemd` service modules](./usage/systemd-services.md)
- management of [system level packages](./usage/environment.md)
- management of [files and permissions](./usage/environment.md)

> **Note**: Docs can fall out of date. Please refer to the [module itself](https://github.com/numtide/system-manager/blob/main/nix/modules/default.nix) for an exhaustive look at what is supported.

If an option you would like to see is not currently supported, please consider [contributing
to the project](./contributing.md), or open an issue and a maintainer may add support if time allows.
